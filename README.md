# Taular Data Science project - Tools for automating and improving feature selection
This project is my project for the "Tabular Data Science" science, Bar-Ilan University, winter 
semester 2024.\
This project is about implementing a suite of algorithms for automated feature selection from tabular data, meant to pick subsets of features that are as close to optimal as possible in a reasonable frame of time. The algorithms are implemented in Python, and are based on existing algorithms and papers.

In this repository, aside from the code and implementations of the various algorithms,
you can find the following:
- A detailed report on the algorithms, as well as the results of the experiments conducted.
- A Jupyter notebook, where you can see the code in action, as well as run the the experiments yourself, either on the data provided or on your own data.
